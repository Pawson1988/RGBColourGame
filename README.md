# RGBColourGame

You've probably seen this game before. However, I learnt a lot from doing this and consolidated a lot of my knowledge...

Such as really understanding how loops work in general with the counter variable and how well loops work with event listeners too. 

Also how we can use CSS together with Javascript. 

This also helped me understand functional programming a lot more too. 

I plan on making this my own as soon as I've finished with other projects such as "myQuiz" in my repositories. 

While I do code-alongs on courses I always listen to the instruction and try it on my own before I watch the next part of the video, this allows me to absorb
the knowledge a lot better and also come up against bugs that I wouldn't otherwise have and ives me the opportunity to debug.
